- So far, we’ve been focusing on accuracy as the foundation for evaluating model quality.
- Accuracy can be a decent metric when classes are “balanced” equally, but even then, in some situations the importance or weight of correct and incorrect predictions might be very different.
- Keeping the importance of context in mind, you first should ask yourself whether you are targeting the correct data column in your model.
