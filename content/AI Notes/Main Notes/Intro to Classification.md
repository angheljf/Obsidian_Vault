- **Classification** is the action or process of categorizing something according to shared qualities or characteristics.
- **Logistic Regression** can be used to predict discrete outcomes from data.
- The logistic regression model mathematically determines the probability of the sample belonging to a class. The following image provides a visual representation of this process with a sigmoid curve:

- In any logistic regression model, the sigmoid function transforms the modelâ€™s predictions about, in this case, the borrower, into a single probability value.
