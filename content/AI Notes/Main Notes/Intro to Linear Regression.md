- **Linear regression** is a method used for predicting continuous values.
- Linear regression is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between a numerical response and one or more variables that explain that response.
- There are two basic types of linear regression:
	- **Simple linear regression**: Describes the relationship between one dependent variable and one independent variable.
	- **Multiple linear regression**: Describes the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables.
- Simple linear regression model:
```text
y = a + bx
```
- Three linear trends are possible:
	- Positive trends: As the independent value _**x**_ increases, the dependent value _**y**_ increases.
	- Negative trends: As the independent value _**x**_ increases, the dependent value _**y**_ decreases.
	- No trend: As the independent value _**x**_ increases, the dependent value _**y**_ randomly increases and decreases to the point at which there is no clear pattern in the data.
