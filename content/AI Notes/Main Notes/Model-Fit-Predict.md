- Model-fit-predict is a three-stage pattern commonly used within supervised learning.
- **Model**: We first consider our data to select a machine learning algorithm.
- **Fit**: We present this data to the algorithm, which learns from this data to form a predictive model. Also know as the **training stage**.
- **Predict**: We can use the resulting predictive model to translate a new set of input data to the correct output.
