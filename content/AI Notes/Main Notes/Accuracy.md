- **Accuracy** is simply a measurement of how many correct results a model returns.
- This can be calculated by dividing the true negatives and true positives from your confusion matrix by the total number of results.

$$Accuracy = {(TN + TP) \over (TN + FP + FN + TP)}$$
- Accuracy is a perfectly acceptable measurement to use if all the outcomes are roughly of equal importance.
