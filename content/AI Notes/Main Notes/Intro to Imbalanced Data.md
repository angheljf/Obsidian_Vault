- **Imbalanced data** occurs when one or more classes in the data are much more or less frequent than the other classes.
- Models trained on certain datasets with imbalanced data can skew to the majority result while still appearing to be effective according to accuracy alone.
- With imbalanced data, you run the risk of training a model that is better at predicting the majority class over the minority class because model fitting algorithms are designed to minimize the number of total incorrect classifications.
- One way to coerce a model to predict the minority class more often lies in over- and undersampling.
