- Deep neural networks are a subset of artificial neural networks, with the major distinction that deep learning models contain more than one hidden layer.

- The nuances of what happens in each layer may be challenging to unpack, but it’s clear that deep learning models can allow developers to make accurate predictions based on complex relationships in data.
## Demystifying the Black Box

- [TensorFlow](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=spiral&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=8&seed=0.14370&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=true&xSquared=true&ySquared=true&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) has created a visualization to illustrate the effect that additional hidden layers can have on model performance and loss, in particular.

- Next, we will do an activity where we try to predict wine quality using deep learning.
