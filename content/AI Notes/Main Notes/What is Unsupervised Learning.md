- [[Unsupervised Learning]] involves the use of an algorithm that analyze unlabeled data in order to identify trends, relationships and other patterns within the data.
- It can be used in two different ways: 
	- [[Clustering]] or to determine patterns.
	- To transform the data for use in a supervised or deep learning model.
- There are some challenges with unsupervised learning: 
	-  We don't know if the output data is correct since the input dataset is not labeled.
	-  Understanding the clusters since the algorithm creates its own categories.
- Examples of uses:
	- Customer segmentation -> [[Using the K-Means Algorithm]] , [[Spending Beyond our K-Means]]
	- Email spam detection.
	- Sentiment analysis.
