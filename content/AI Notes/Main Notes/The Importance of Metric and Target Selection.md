- Before starting a machine learning project, it's crucial to carefully select the target variable and the evaluation metric. Different problems require different priorities in terms of outcomes.
- In the field of predictive modeling, there is a responsibility to implement models ethically, especially when they can impact people's lives. Ethical considerations should start with the choice of the target column and metric.
- Using a target column like "loan approved" to predict new loan applications can perpetuate existing biases in the approval process. It's essential to be aware of and mitigate these biases.
- Selecting the right metric doesn't guarantee a well-performing model, but it ensures that you can measure its performance accurately. If a model underperforms, you can identify where the problem lies.
