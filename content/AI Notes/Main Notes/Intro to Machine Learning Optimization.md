- **Machine learning optimization** is the process of improving the performance of a machine learning model by adjusting its parameters and hyperparameters.
- This is done by running the model on a training dataset and evaluating its performance on a validation dataset, then adjusting the parameters to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy or other performance metrics.
