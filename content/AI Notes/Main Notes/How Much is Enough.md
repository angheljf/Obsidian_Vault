- When working on machine learning, there is always more tweaking that CAN be done. Deciding when to call it “good enough” is a difficult task.
- Often, understanding minimum requirements and project budgets prior to beginning to build a model can help.
- When working on traditional machine learning models, it’s often better to spend the majority of your time preprocessing and a small amount of time tuning the model. For neural networks, this can actually be the opposite!
