- In all cases, **ensemble learning** techniques combine predictions from two or more models.
- The concept of ensemble learning is the process of combining multiple models, like decision trees, to help improve the accuracy and robustness of the final model. 
- At the same time, ensemble learning decreases the variance of the final model. Therefore, the overall performance increases.
- As the following image shows, with ensemble learning we feed data to multiple algorithms that each make a prediction. Then we use the accumulated predictions to make a final prediction:

- If we compare the performance of classification algorithms, we find that some algorithms perform better than others. 
- The algorithms that fail at learning in an adequate fashion are termed **weak learners**.
- Weak learners are valuable because there are models that can combine many weak learners to create a more accurate and robust prediction engine.
