- In the previous module, you learned that the models youâ€™ve worked with so far have a limited ability to understand complex relationships in data.
- For example, these models may be best suited for making predictions about linearly separable data, which means that it can be separated by a straight line when plotted in two dimensions.
- An example of a linearly separable dataset could be credit card applications that are either approved or not approved:

- However, non-linear data introduces a need for a different kind of architecture in the models altogether.

- **Neural networks** have the power to make predictions based on datasets that are too complex for other types of machine learning algorithms to process.
- They are capable of receiving input information, placing some weight or importance on that input, and using that judgment to inform the behavior of other parts of the knowledge system.
