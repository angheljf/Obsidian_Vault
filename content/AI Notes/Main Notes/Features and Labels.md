- **Features**: In supervised learning, features predict labels, because they are the attributes of the label. Also known as **independent variables**.
- **Labels**: Labels depend on the features, as labels are the outcome that you want to predict. Also known as **dependent variables**.
- Example of Pandas DataFrame with features and labels highlighted:

- Some independent variables might have a very limited impact on the dependent variable. That is why some features are removed when performing supervised learning.
- In summary, supervised learning uses features and labels to train algorithms to classify new data and predict outcomes.
