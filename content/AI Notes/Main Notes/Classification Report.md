- A classification report collates precision, sensitivity, and the F1 score and displays it in the following table:
![[classification-report-example.png]]
- In this example, the test data contained 192 data points. Of the total data points, 125 were actually false, and 67 were actually true. The precision score for negative predictions was 0.78 and 0.75 for positive. The sensitivity (recall) for negative predictions was 0.9 and 0.54 for positive, and the F1 score can be read in the same way. The overall accuracy sits at 78% and the averages for the macro and weighted average are shown in the last two rows of the table.
