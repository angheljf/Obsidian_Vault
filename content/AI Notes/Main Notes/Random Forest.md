- A **random forest** comprises a collection of simpler and smaller decision trees that operate as an ensemble.
- These simple trees are weak learners because they are created by randomly sampling the data and creating a decision tree for only that small portion of data.
- Random forest algorithms are beneficial because they:
	- Are robust against overfitting as all of those weak learners are trained on different pieces of the data;
	- Can be used to rank the importance of input variables in a natural way;
	- Can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion;
	- Are robust to outliers and non-linear data; and
	- Run efficiently on large datasets.
