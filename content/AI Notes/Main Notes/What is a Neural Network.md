- **Artificial neural networks**, or neural networks as they are more commonly known, are algorithms that draw inspiration for their name and structure from neurons in the human brain.
- Neural networks consist of layers of artificial neurons that perform individual computations and communicate the results of the computations between themselves.
- Versatile neural networks can detect complex relationships in datasets that traditional statistical or machine learning models can't.
- However, neural networks have their share of disadvantages too. While the complexity of their algorithms makes neural networks powerful tools for data analysis, the same complexity can be beyond human understanding, resulting in what's known as aÂ **black box problem**.

- In a black box system, the input is known and the output can be observed; however, the process to get from the input to output is unknown.
- Another disadvantage is that neural networks are prone to overfitting the training data, this means that the model might struggle to generalize data trends for data sets beyond its training data.
